# Blurryface

Twenty Øne Piløts is not just a band. It's a story full of shadows, secrets, and hidden messages.
They created a unique universe where music, visuals, and symbolism intertwine, exploring themes of identity, fear, and self-discovery.

This Blurryface Era page was created thanks to **The Odin Project**.

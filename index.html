          Twenty One Pilots is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio.
          Initially a band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler

          Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer
          Josh Dun. The duo is best known for their singles "Stressed Out",
          "Ride", and "Heathens", which achieved commercial success between 2015
          and 2016. The duo received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group
